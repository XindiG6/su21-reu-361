## Abstract

Blockchain-based cryptocurrency is a popular investment of today's age. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warns that high-risk accompanies these investments[^1]. This project applies machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to historical records of these coins to predict future prices; this aims to minimize investment risk.

## 1. Introduction

Blockchain is "an open, distributed ledger" which records transactions of cryptocurrency. It is decentralized, which means that these transactions are shared and distributed among all participants on the blockchain for maximum accountability. Furthermore, this new "blockchain" technology is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to mainstream transactions through traditional banks[^2].

An attractive new invention such as blockchain is a particularly desirable investment opportunity. However, its severe volatility can scare away possible investors; in 2017, one Bitcoin was worth $1,000 USD; a year later, its value multiplied by 20; and just a few months later, it decreased back down to $5,000[^3].

Artificial intelligence will be applied in this experiment to predict the future price of blockchain cryptocurrencies on the Electro-Optical System.

## 2. Datasets

This project utilizes a .csv file containing the historical prices of the EOS coin from the first day of its inception on 1 July 2017, to the last scraped day 12 December 2020[^4]. From this data, the project will attempt to predict the prices from the end date until the present day.

## 3. Using Images

## 4. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common
 
## 5. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 6. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 7. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
