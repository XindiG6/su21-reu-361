**Keywords:** tensorflow, example. 

## To-do

- [ ] My first research on blockchain
- [ ] Add blockchain explanation to introduction
- [ ] What does blockchain have to do with AI?
- [ ] What codes exist that demonstrate the use of blockchain with AI using Python?
- [ ] What is the code in this project that will be developed?
- [ ] What is the performance of this code?
- [ ] What is my conclusion?
- [ ] Never, ever use the words 'I' or 'my' in a report

## Tutorials

- [ ] Install software Visual Studio Code (create video tutorial or written instructions)

## 1. Introduction

Here comes a convincing introduction to the problem


## 2. Report Format


## 3. Using Images

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].


## 4. Benchmark


Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]

 
## 5. Conclusion


A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.


## 6. Acknowledgments


Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.
