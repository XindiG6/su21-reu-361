## To-do

- [x] My first research on blockchain
- [x] Add blockchain explanation to introduction
- [ ] What does blockchain have to do with AI?
- [ ] What codes exist that demonstrate the use of blockchain with AI using Python?
- [ ] What is the code in this project that will be developed?
- [ ] What is the performance of this code?
- [ ] What is my conclusion?
- [ ] Never, ever use the words 'I' or 'my' in a report

## Tutorials

- [x] Install software Visual Studio Code (create video tutorial or written instructions)

## 1. Introduction

Blockchain is "an open, distributed ledger" which records transactions of cryptocurrency. It is decentralized, which means that these transactions are shared and distributed among all participants on the blockchain for maximum accountability. Furthermore, this new "blockchain" technology is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to mainstream transactions through traditional banks[^1].

An attractive new invention such as blockchain is a particularly desirable investment opportunity. However, its severe volatility can scare away possible investors; in 2017, one Bitcoin was worth $1,000 USD; a year later, its value multiplied by 20; and just a few months later, it decreased back down to $5,000[^2].

Artificial intelligence will be applied in this experiment to predict the future price of blockchain cryptocurrencies on the Electro-Optical System.

## 2. Datasets

- [ ] Find online price checker and rip/scalp prices

## 3. Using Images

![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].

## 4. Benchmark

Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]
 
## 5. Conclusion

A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.

## 6. Acknowledgments

Please add acknowledgments to all that contributed or helped on this project.

## 7. References

Your report must include at least 6 references. Please use customary academic citation and not just URLs. As we will at 
one point automatically change the references from superscript to square brackets it is best to introduce a space before 
the first square bracket.
