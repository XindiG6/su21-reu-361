# yfinance-lstm.ipynb Instructions

Please ensure you have downloaded the code folder. GitHub and git makes this easy
through cloning of the repo. Cloning is impossible without first installing Git.
Also, an IDE must be installed, such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

Alternatively one can download the repository as a ZIP and extract it by clicking
the green Code button on GitHub.

Once downloaded, open the yfinance-lstm.ipynb in an IDE, preferably in a Python
virtual environment. Tutorials on how to start a virtual environment are in the
tutorials folder of the repo. Then, ensure all the Python modules that are imported
within the first cell of yfinance-lstm.ipynb are installed with pip (preferably
within virtual environment).

Then, click Run All. There will be a prompt to input the ticker of the cryptocurrency.
Enter it, and the program should do the rest.

However, near the end of the program, there is a line that zooms into the axes of
the graph. The parameters should be manually changed so that it zooms into a point
of interest. Because cryptocurrencies have wildly varying prices, this must be
changed on a case-by-case basis
