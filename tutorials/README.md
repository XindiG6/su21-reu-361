# Tutorials

These tutorials are better than searching through online documentation because
these tutorials are tailored to REU. They also address any common errors
that REU participants have previously encountered. If these errors were not
addressed, it would result in many more open tabs of stackoverflow on a web
browser, so the authors hope that your work goes a bit more smoothly as a
result of these tutorials.
